Heyo! My name is Prateek and I'm a junior at the University of Pennsylvania in the [Vagelos LSM Program](https://lsm.upenn.edu/). I'm currently very interested in biotech, finance, and computer science. 

Over the past couple of years I've done research at [Harmonic Discovery](https://www.harmonicdiscovery.com/) and at the [Zhou Lab](https://zhou-lab.github.io/) @ The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

My research interests are in computational epigenetics, AI applied to the drug discovery process, and translational medicine.

Outside of work you can find me:
- singing with my [acapella group](https://www.youtube.com/@PennMasalaOfficial)
- making music with some of my friends
- listening to podcasts ([1](https://conversationswithtyler.com/),[2](https://open.spotify.com/show/59176gU8vcFho6Sc1dm3Lu?si=289fff304ec94193))
- or talking about [movies and shows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiplash_(2014_film)) with my friends

Thanks for stopping by and feel free to [reach out](mailto:padurty@wharton.upenn.edu) to me about anything!
